## 🧁 BakeSmart
# 📌 Project Overview

BakeSmart is a full-stack online bakery developed using Python, Django, MongoDB, and React.js.
The application allows users to browse bakery products, manage carts, place orders, generate bills and receive personalized product recommendations based on order history.If user login as Admin it allows user to do CRUD operations on products.
This project was developed as an Individual Project during Semester 4, focusing on full-stack development, backend logic and database integration.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

# 🧩 Project Structure

The project is divided into three major parts:

1️⃣ MongoDB Backend

  - Stores bakery products in a product collection
  - Implements CRUD operations for product management

2️⃣ Django Backend

  Contains multiple Django apps:
    - Accounts App: Manages user registration and authentication
    - Orders App: Handles order placement and order history
    - Recommendations App: Provides product recommendations based on user behavior

3️⃣ Frontend

  - Built using React.js
  - Displays products fetched from MongoDB backend
  - Includes login, signup, cart, checkout and order pages
  - Handles user interactions smoothly through reusable components

# 🧠 Implementation Details

- Backend APIs built using Django
- Data stored and retrieved using MongoDB
- Uses JSON-based communication between frontend and backend
- Recommendation logic based on previous user orders
- Clean separation of frontend and backend logic

# ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
  git clone <repository-link>
2. Start the Django backend server.
3. Set up MongoDB database.
4. Run the React frontend.
5. Access the application via browser.
